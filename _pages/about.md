Hi, I’m Haoyu Zhao (赵灏宇) — welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a PhD student in the [vLAR](https://vlar-group.github.io/) group at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof. Bo Yang. My research focuses on 3D computer vision, specifically object point cloud analysis.

Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Wuhan University in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in the [MARS](https://marswhu.github.io/) group led by Prof. Mang Ye, where I began my academic journey and completed my undergraduate project.
